/*!
 * A Stream is a virtual set of connections to all other worker instances,
 * hence a "Stream" bundles them to a logical communication context. We call an
 * individual connection from a worker to another worker a "Host".
 *
 * To use a Stream, one can get a vector of BlockWriter via OpenWriters() of
 * outbound Stream. The vector is of size of workers in the system.
 * One can then write items destined to the
 * corresponding worker. The written items are buffered into a Block and only
 * sent when the Block is full. To force a send, use BlockWriter::Flush(). When
 * all items are sent, the BlockWriters **must** be closed using
 * BlockWriter::Close().
 *
 * To read the inbound Connection items, one can get a vector of BlockReader via
 * OpenReaders(), which can then be used to read items sent by individual
 * workers.
 *
 * Alternatively, one can use OpenReader() to get a BlockReader which delivers
 * all items from *all* worker in worker order (concatenating all inbound
 * Connections).
 *
 * As soon as all attached streams of the Stream have been Close() the number of
 * expected streams is reached, the stream is marked as finished and no more
 * data will arrive.
