/*!
 * A Stream is a virtual set of connections to all other worker instances,
 * hence a "Stream" bundles them to a logical communication context. We call an
 * individual connection from a worker to another worker a "Host".
 *
 * To use a Stream, one can get a vector of BlockWriter via OpenWriters() of
 * outbound Stream. The vector is of size of workers in the system.  One can
 * then write items destined to the corresponding worker. The written items are
 * buffered into a Block and only sent when the Block is full. To force a send,
 * use BlockWriter::Flush(). When all items are sent, the BlockWriters **must**
 * be closed using BlockWriter::Close().
 *
 * The MixStream allows reading of items from all workers in an unordered
 * sequence, without waiting for any of the workers to complete sending items.
